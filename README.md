This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I used [this guide](https://www.robinwieruch.de/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/#react-application-setup) for the initial auth set up.

## still left to do
### routes & implementation

* tests
* reorganize the react?
* add in prep and cook times?

### api

### misc
